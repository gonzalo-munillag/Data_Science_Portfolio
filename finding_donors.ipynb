    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "This leaves one classifier left for testing. Looking at the high bias algorithms, logistic regression has low bias, which might make it a good candidate according to that reference. According to stanford, GaussianNB has also high bias and this explains why gaussianNB is considered immune to high variance: https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Naive-Bayes-classifiers-considered-relatively-immune-to-overfitting\n",

    "Because we have a large amount of categiral features, and GaussianNB is known for being good for those cases, **we will choose GaussianNB our 3rd candidate.** \n",

    "### SVM\n",
    "1. It is used to classify text and hypertext, images, hand-written characters, and has been widely applied in medical use cases.\n",
    "2. Effective in high dimensional spaces, still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples, uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient, and it is versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n",
    "3. If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial. SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation. It is slow to compute.\n",
    "4. **Inherently it has a nob for increasing or lowering bias. Thus, the assumption from stanford that we need a low bias algorithm can be easily changed if we see it does not hold true with this number of records and features.** \n",

    "### KNN\n",
    "1. (i) Credit ratings — collecting financial characteristics vs. comparing people with similar financial features to a database. (ii) hould the bank give a loan to an individual? (iii) In political science — classing a potential voter to a “will vote” or “will not vote”, or to “vote Democrat” or “vote Republican”.\n",
    "2. Very little training time. Good with multiclass settings. Simple to implement. \n",
    "3. KNN does well when there are more classification types, we might not leverage it so much with just 2 types. While training is fast, it is computationally expensive in testing phase which is impractical in industry settings. KNN can suffer from skewed class distributions (which is our case, we have an imbalance outcome). Finally, the accuracy of KNN can be severely degraded with high-dimension data because there is little difference between the nearest and farthest neighbor.\n",
    "4. **After researching KNN more deeply (see point 3), it seems that it is not going to be a great algorithm for the task at hand. it is good for unsupervised learning and when there are multiple classes makes more sense than wasting potential on just 2 classes.**\n",

    "### Logistic regression\n",
    "1. Spam Detection, Credit Card Fraud, and tumour Prediction.\n",
    "2. Logistic Regression performs well when the dataset is linearly separable. Logistic regression is less prone to over-fitting but it can overfit in high dimensional datasets. You should consider Regularization (L1 and L2) techniques to avoid over-fitting in these scenarios. Logistic Regression not only gives a measure of how relevant a predictor (coefficient size) is, but also its direction of association (positive or negative). Logistic regression is easier to implement, interpret and very efficient to train. \n",
    "3. Main limitation of Logistic Regression is the assumption of linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables. In the real world, the data is rarely linearly separable. Most of the time data would be a jumbled mess. If the number of observations are lesser than the number of features, Logistic Regression should not be used, otherwise it may lead to overfit. Logistic Regression can only be used to predict discrete functions. Therefore, the dependent variable of Logistic Regression is restricted to the discrete number set. This restriction itself is problematic, as it is prohibitive to the prediction of continuous data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)\n",
    "1. Google (and most certainly other email providers), use this classifier to separate spam from not spam. It is also known to be applied to Real time prediction, multi class predictions, and recommendation systems.\n",
    "2. It performs well when the number of features is very large, plus it performs well when there are many categorial values. As the features of the dataset to be studied would be words, and because emails have a great variaty of them,  GaussianNB is goof for classifying emails. It also is unaffected by the presence of irrelevant features. It is also a simple algorithm that does not need much tunning. Furthermore, the ratio of computation time vs. data is very low. And the last positive aspects is that it rarely overfits and it works well when there are multiple classes to predict. \n",
    "3. One of the weaknesses is that it makes the assumption that the events included are independent (hence the name od naive). This, however, introduces a small error (in the course shown cases).  There is literature that does not consider GNB a good classifier ad it is inherentily assuming independence of events.\n",
    "4. Given that there are 103 features (most of which were categorical before), which from my experience in this course could be considered large, I therefore think this is a good model to use for classification. There is not too much data, and that has shown to serve well for Gaussian classification. It also has low bias, which is a wanted property for a low amount of training data. It is fast to compute as well.\n",

    "ML pipelines are awesome tools. A Pipeline can specified as a sequence of stages which runs these sequence of stages one after the other. What this achieves is that, imagine you are working on large ML projects and you need to find out which model performs best. You’ll then often experiment with the models to see which one works better and also what combination of parameters work best. A pipeline helps us with repeatable task without the same implementation steps for each algorithm every time. It basically helps you with the hard work.\n",

    "3. GBMs are more sensitive to overfitting if the data is noisy. Training generally takes longer because of the fact that trees are built sequentially. GBMs are harder to tune than random forests. There are typically three parameters: number of trees, depth of trees and learning rate, and each tree built is generally shallow.\n",
    "4. It is highly adaptable to the situation. Even though literature says that it tends to overfit (that is why I did not take it in the beginning), it did not happen. Thus, we select this method (aside form the fact that we have shown that performs better), for its flexibility.\n",

    "I will first explain ensemble methods, then boosting, and then gradient boost classifer. \n",
    "Boosting is a subcategory of ensemble methods, and gradient boosting is a subcategory of boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to go to 3 paragraphs because this classifier has 3 things to explain, however, the bolded sentences might be a good summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first, what are ensemble method?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind enesemble methods is to combine models and average their predictions to create an ultimate better model. The perfect model does not exist, that is why we sometimes must combine models. Some are very rigid and cannot adapt well to the data (high vs low bias) so you would have very lousy predictions, and others are vey flexibile and essentially copy the data they are trained on (low vs high variance), which it will not help you to predict new values. Like memorising for a test without uderstanding, this is not helpful. By combining models, we find a trade-off between these 2 problems. **This is the major quality of ensembling methods, combining worse models to make a better one.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, what is boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "So, within esemble methods, there is a category that has shown better results. These are the boosting methods.\n",
    "We have said that we combine models, let us call them weak learenrs, to make better ones. In boosting, we implement a one weak learner after another, sequentially. So we have a sub-set of data (we have picked randomly from a bigger set), and we train this first weak model on it. Afterwards, we check the errors it has made in the predicitons. Knowing these errors, we make the next weak learner focus on fixing them (incorrected classified points become more important and make the next weak learner to gravitate towards them). We do thos multiple times. Once we are done, we give a weight to each weak model depending on how well they have performed their individual predicitons. After giving each a weight, we sum the weights to obtain the last and best model. The weights will be positive or negative depending on whether the classifer identifies as one type or another. Furthermore, the types can be represented in space (imagine e.g. a 2D grid). So this weak models provide a +/- weight to different areas. Summing the weights on these areas will yield a final +/- value, and depending on that, points falling on one or the other are will be of one type or another. \n",
    "**Training is building these areas, and prediciting is plotting a new point in this space and see on which area it lands. Depending on it, it will be one or the other type.**\n",
    "**The major quality of boosting is that it comabines weak learners sequentially, one improving upon the mistakes of the previos one.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, what is gradient boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Within boosting, we have adaptive and gradient boosting. Gradient boosting has shown better results, so we have decided to use it.  \n",
    "How adaptive boosting works is explained in the previous paragraph. It was the first type of boosting created and it is intuitive. Gradient boosting is an improved model in boosting. It turns out, that researchers found that ada boosting is a specific case within a more general form, this general form can be built with the so called Gradient boosting. Gradient boosting is more adaptable to the data and thus usually provides better results.\n",
    "Gradient boosting however works differently. While adaboost uses an accuracy-based metric to give weights to the missclassified points so the next weak learner focuses on them (mind that these are not the weaks of the weak learner, but the points on which the weak learner is beeing trained), gradient boosting utilizes a mathematical technique called gradient descent to calculate these weights. This mathematical technique is known to provide good empirical results and as we see in this case, better than adaboosting. Lastly, gradient descent is a technique that takes little steps on an error function with the aim to minimize the error. So in practice, after each weak learner is trained, gradient descent is use to check in which direction should we change the weight of the points to minimize the error.\n",

    "Now that you have got the correct Implementation of GrisSearchCV, lets take a moment to think why are we using GridSearchCV in the first place. Can we not search for the optimum parameters manually ? The answer is: we can, we don’t need to use GridSearchCV and can write all the required code manually. Without GridSearchCV we would need to loop over the parameters and then run all the combinations of parameters. If we were then to use cross-validated result, we would also need to add the code to find the best average CV results across all the combinations of aparameters. Rather than doing all this coding and hard work, we have used GridSearchCV to find the optimum parameters from a given set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearch is not the only technique available to us though! Another similar technique worth looking is RandomizedSearchCV\n",
    "\n",
    "While GridSearchCV works with the explicitly declared values, RandomizedSearchCV doesn't search every value. Instead, it samples random subsets and then uses them to find the optimum parameter value.\n",

    "\n",
    "But in applied ML scenarios, we have seen that that RandomizedSearchCV performs better than its counterpart, by often finding the optimal value much faster. So it turns out RandomizedSearchCV is great. Another great thing about this method is that it samples from value distribution rather than the pre-determined values.\n",

In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

The workclass falls in the same idea as the previous one more or less. Depending on the level of education, your starting salary is higher or lower by several thousands of monetary units. Also, the more senior you are, the more experience you have and thus you earn more. Lastly, if your investments are doing well, that will make your income go high."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "As data collection has become easy and efficient, datasets now a day have become very rich in information. So understanding the dataset is always a good choice as this always saves a lot of troubles later. The data are often high dimensional and it is quite common to see datasets with hundreds of features and is not unusual to see it go to tens of thousands.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, first thing that comes to our mind is: More features mean better for the model right ? Well not always !\n",
    "When a model is presented data with very high dimensionality which means a huge number of features, models usually choke. This is because:\n",
    "\n",
    "    As no of features increases, training time increases exponentially.\n",
    "    Models often suffer from overfitting with more no of features.\n",
    "    As this nice article points out, “Sometimes Less is better!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection is a very critical step in any Machine Learning algorithm’s workflow. Machine learning follows a simple rule : if you put garbage in, you will only get garbage as your output. In our case garbage will be noisy data.\n",
    "What feature selection does is that it prioritizes features so that you can decide how many of them you’d like to choose.\n",
    "Top reasons to use feature selection are:\n",
    "• It enables the algorithm to train faster.\n",
    "• It reduces the complexity of a model and makes it easier to interpret.\n",
    "• It improves the accuracy of a model if the right subset is chosen.\n",
    "• It reduces overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something to note here is that there are a lot of methods for implementing feature selection. Below are some of the most common one:\n",
    "• SelectBest\n",
    "• SelectPercentile\n",
    "A more advanced method is Recursive Feature Elimination. Recursive feature elimination is based on the idea to repeatedly construct a model (for example an SVM or a regression model) and choose either the best or worst performing feature (for example based on coefficients), setting the feature aside and then repeating the process with the rest of the features. This process is applied until all features in the dataset are exhausted. Features are then ranked according to when they were eliminated. As such, it is a greedy optimization for finding the best performing subset of features.\n",
